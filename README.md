# assembly-syscall-benchmark
This tool compares the execution times of two assembly programs, one using the int 0x80 system call and the other using syscall. It assembles, links, and benchmarks each program multiple times, calculates average execution times, and shows the percentage difference, helping analyze which method is faster.
